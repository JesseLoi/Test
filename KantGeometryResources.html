    The mechanical drawing (p. 393), which presupposes it as its rule, does not come into play here at all. 
    The possibility of a straight line and a circle cannot be proved indirectly by inference, but only directly, 
    by the construction of these concepts (which is not empirical at all), due to the fact that under all constructions (representations in intuition a priori determined according to a rule), must be the first, such as the <b>drawing or describing (in thought) </b> of a straight line and the turning of such a line about a fixed point, where neither of the latter can be derived from the former…
